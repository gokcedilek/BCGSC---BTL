Physlr is a software program that aims to output a mapping of chromosomes or DNA molecules, which can be used for their assembly. 
Physlr uses a dataset of reads (DNA sequences) generated by linked read sequencing, which is a sequencing technology that assigns identifier barcodes to each read of sequenced DNA fragments (fragment = a smaller piece of a large DNA molecule).
The condition for assigning the barcodes is, the reads that come from the same long DNA molecule (molecule = a smaller piece of a whole chromosome), will get the same barcode.
This barcode to molecule mapping enables us to assemble larger pieces of DNA molecules, using first barcode, and then molecule overlap information. 
However, a core challenge is, barcodes are reused for different molecules, and this makes the job a difficult overlap problem to tackle.
Physlr is a modular tool that is composed of multiple stages, and during my Co-op term at the Bioinformatics Technology Lab, the stage of Physlr that I was involved with was filtering outlier barcodes and minimizers, before building barcode and molecule overlap graphs.
